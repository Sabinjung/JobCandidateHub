What I have used:
1. Implemented repositories and services to abstract database logic, enabling easier migration to other database systems.
2. Used FluentValidation to validate inputs systematically.
3. Used API compression to enhance performance by reducing the size of responses.
4. Used memory caching to reduce database load and improve response times.

List of Improvements:
1. Implemented memory caching for enhanced scalability; however, we can further improve by integrating a distributed caching system like Redis.
2. To prepare for future codebase growth, we can adopt Clean Architecture by separating projects into distinct layers, such as Infrastructure and Core.
